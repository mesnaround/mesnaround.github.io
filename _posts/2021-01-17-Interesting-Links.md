### Anti-Gerrymandering
[Redistricting and The Will of The People](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8796) 
Many people are aware of the practice of Gerrymandering throughout state-level legislatures in the United States. Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing geographical boundaries that define representative districts to suit a political party. As common knowledge and this paper from 2014 shows, this practice can be skewed from the proportional vote in an election. Some states assign an independent body with the responsibility to draw these lines while others the power lies with the legislature. This flexibility of the system to partisan interests is essentially a loophole in democracy and should be fixed through a sound statistically based approach.
