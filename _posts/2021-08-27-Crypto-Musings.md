### An Investment?
Someone close to me the other day asked for my opinion on cryptocurrency. I happily obliged as it's one of the many topics I feel somewhat knowledgeable about but at the same time out of the loop. She asked me, "what do you think of cryptocurrency as an investment?"

Some people are extremely bullish on cryptocurrency and like to geek out about the tech. Still others are bullish and understand very little of it. Others are very bearish about it and are still awaiting for it's eventual collapse. I for one have never been able to get a grasp on it. 

When I was in a Data Science bootcamp I did a project trying to predict the next day return rate direction (key word direction not magnitude) of bitcoin return rates. Using SVMs we were able to get a model with something over 80% specificity. There was also an arbitrage opportunity at the time not considering outrageous transaction costs. This was back in the summer of 2017. 

One of the main takeaways from this effort was that the daily return rate was non-Gaussian. In fact, it fit very well a Cauchy distribution which has no mean or variance. It's inherently unstable with very long tails. One of the guys involved in this bootcamp actually wanted to put some money in if we wanted to use our model for real. I never took him up on his offer and I have no regrets there. I was always very uncomfortable with this unstable behavior of bitcoin not to mention the outrageous energy usage, poor privacy, and manipulability of the market. How cool it would be if proof of work could actually be for something useful like particle collider simulations, quantum chemistry calculations, or some other distributable problem needing massive compute resources?

So I don't know if you could call bitcoin an investment per se. I prefer the Benjamin Graham term "speculation" but perhaps this view is out-dated?
