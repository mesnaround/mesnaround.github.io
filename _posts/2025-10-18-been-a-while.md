## Setting an Intention

After much consideration I decided to use up all of my days at work and take a long vacation. I needed to take a step back to reinvigorate my passion for problem solving. It hasn't been the most productive stretch so far, but it has been so great to have the space to decompress.

## Home Assistant?

One thing I've been spending my time on for the past 2 weeks has been Home Assistant. I had installed it a couple years ago on an extra Raspberry Pi 3 that I had, but I since bought a dedicated Raspberry Pi 4 board and installed HASS OS on it. After standing it up, I spent some time setting up a simple camera to display a live feed from a Raspberry Pi Pico W with NOIR Camera. I did eventually get it to work but after some false starts, and not with the success I had hoping. Doing nice security cams from scratch are hard and time consuming. 

Another card I set up at the time, was the url to a gif loop of the Doppler radar for New England. This I have consistently looked at over the last couple of years when there are thunderstorm warnings in the area, or other general weather patterns.

Now with the extra time on my hands, I wanted to see if I could get a more robust layout of historical weather data. Here in New England, we are in a drought, and the late summers for the last 2-3 years have contained large stretches of no rain. I am also into gardening so I would like to have a quick referenence of the amount of rain we have received over the last X number of days where X is say 60.
